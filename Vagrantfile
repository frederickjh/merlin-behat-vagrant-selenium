  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # enable this to have the vm bridge your local network and get an ip from dhcp

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:

   config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  
      # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  
      # more cpus to try and speed up build time
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "2"]
  
      # increase cpu cap
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuexecutioncap", "80"]
  
      # this is apparenly required for a 64 bit guest and multiple virtual cpus
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on"]

  # Enable provisioning with Puppet stand alone.  Puppet manifests
